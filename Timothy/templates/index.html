          <h3>Here is a little about me</h3>
          <p>
            My name is <span>Timothy Olaonipekun Omoniyi</span>
            I am a self-taught and bootcamp-trained full-stack developer who recently transitioned into the tech industry.
            I discovered my love for programming through Python and have been learning the language via various online resources,
            including Udemy. This eventually led me to complete the Le Wagon Bootcamp in Barcelona, where I gained valuable experience
            working on group projects. Despite being employed as a delivery driver for Amazon, I have been dedicating my free time
            to continuing my studies, particularly in the area of Python with a focus on the Django framework.
            I am currently enrolled in a course offered by Harvard University(CS50) and am making progress towards my goal of becoming
            a skilled and competent developer. As I am eager to gain more hands-on experience in the field,
            I would be grateful for any opportunity, even a non-payable internship, to work with a team and contribute
            to the development of real-world projects. I am committed to continuous learning and personal development,
            and I believe that such an opportunity would be a valuable step towards achieving my career aspirations.

          <h3>HTML, CSS & Javascript</h3>
          <p>As a skilled web developer, I possess a strong foundation in the core web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am well-versed in using CSS preprocessors such as SCSS and have experience working with popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap to streamline my development process and ensure responsive, accessible, and visually appealing designs.

          <h3>Python and Django</h3>
          <p>Through my dedicated work and the guidance provided by Harvard Courses (CS50), I have been able to develop highly functional and visually stunning web applications. The skills and knowledge that I have acquired from the course have enabled me to create applications that not only meet but exceed the expectations of users.</p>

          <h3>Ruby On Rails</h3>
          <p>Thanks to Le Wagon Bootcamp, I've developed my skills as a Ruby on Rails developer, creating impressive applications such as AirOffice and StudyFlow with ease. Their intensive training and live coaching provided expertise in programming languages and web development frameworks. Collaborating with colleagues enabled me to learn from others, hone my skills and gain a deeper understanding of web development. Teamwork and support have been key to our success.</p>
